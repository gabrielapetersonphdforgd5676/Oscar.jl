# Cones


## Introduction

Let $\mathbb{F}$ be an ordered field; the most prominent case here is where $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{Q}$ are the rational numbers.

A set $C \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$ is called a (polyhedral) cone if it can be written as the set of nonnegative linear combinations of finitely many vectors in $\mathbb{F}^n$.
Equivalently, cones can be written as the intersection of finitely many homogeneous linear inequalities.

Any cone is a special case of a polyhedron.
Conversely, intersecting a cone with a suitable affine hyperplane yields a polyhedron whose faces are in bijection with the faces of the cone.
Going back and forth between polyhedra and their homogenizations, the cones, is a frequent operation.
This is one reason for keeping cones as a distinct type.

## Construction

One can construct a cone through an interior description, analogous  to the $V$-description of a polytope. By providing a collection of vectors, the command `positive_hull` will construct the cone generated by those vectors.
