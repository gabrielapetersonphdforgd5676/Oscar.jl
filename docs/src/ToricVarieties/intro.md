# Toric geometry in Julia

## Introduction

We follow [the book](https://www.ams.org/publications/authors/books/postpub/gsm-124)
`Toric Varieties` by `David A. Cox`, `John B. Little` and `Henry K. Schenck`].
Our goal is to ensure that one can perform all computations of `Appendix B`.
Currently, this project is work-in-progress.
